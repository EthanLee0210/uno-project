Flowchart for the process of the program
- generate deck
- generate player hands

Setup steps:
- How many players?
- - while loop, enter player name or type 'all done'
- construct objects for players
- - these should be in a list I guess?
- - - [the object containing P1 and their hand, the next object, etc]
- draw first card
- - if wild card: continue

Gameplay


Incrementer (run at end of turn):
if play is normal, non-reversed:
    if token == len(players):
        token = 0
    else:
        token += 1
elif play is reversed:
    if token == 0:
        token == len(players)
    else:
        token -= 1
if we are skipping the next player:
    display a message saying you got skipped
    set skip state to false
    run the above one more time

### Further down the road steps
- [ ] A bot to play as p2
- [ ] House rules?
- - continually draw until you can play || draw once and pass?
- - continually play until you can't anymore || play once and pass?
